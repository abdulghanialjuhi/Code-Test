# Multi-Tenant NestJS MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Kafka Service

This project is a **multi-tenant NestJS service** integrating **MongoDB, Elasticsearch**, and **Kafka** for scalable tenant-specific data storage, search, and messaging. The service allows each tenant to have its own isolated resources with a focus on efficient message flows using Kafka consumers and producers.

## Introduction

This NestJS application implements a multi-tenant service with MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Kafka integrations. Each tenant is identified by a unique **tenant ID**, and data storage (MongoDB), search operations (Elasticsearch), and message handling (Kafka) are isolated for each tenant.

The application follows a modular approach with robust error handling, validation, and Kafka event-driven architecture.

## Features

- **Multi-tenant MongoDB**: Isolated databases for each tenant.
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Elasticsearch used for advanced search capabilities.
- **Kafka Consumer/Producer**: Kafka-based messaging system for distributed event handling.
- **Input Validation**: Validates and sanitizes all input.
- **Error Handling**: Clear and actionable errors when a tenant provides incorrect credentials or URIs.
- **Authentication**: Basic authentication and authorization layer to secure endpoints.
- **Future Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple tenants with isolated data and messaging.

## Technologies

- **NestJS**: Framework used to build the API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database, multi-tenant enabled.
- **Elasticsearch**: Search engine for tenant-specific full-text search capabilities.
- **Kafka**: Message broker to enable distributed event handling and microservice communication.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures the API endpoints.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB
- Elasticsearch
- Kafka
- Docker (optional, for running services in containers)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multi-tenant-nestjs-service.git
cd multi-tenant-nestjs-service
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI_default=mongodb://localhost:27017/default_db
MONGODB_URI_tenant1=mongodb://localhost:27017/tenant1_db
MONGODB_URI_tenant2=mongodb://localhost:27017/tenant2_db

# Elasticsearch Configuration
ELASTICSEARCH_NODE=http://localhost:9200
ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY=your_elasticsearch_api_key
ELASTICSEARCH_MESSAGE_INDEX=messages_index

# Kafka Configuration
KAFKA_BROKER_URL=localhost:9092
KAFKA_GROUP_ID=your-kafka-group-id
KAFKA_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
```

### Step 4: Run MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Kafka

Ensure MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Kafka are running, either locally or in Docker containers.

You can use Docker to run all three services:

```bash
# Start MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Kafka using Docker
docker-compose up
```

### Step 5: Start the Application

Run the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Tenant Identification

Each tenant is identified by a unique **tenant ID** passed in the request headers (`x-tenant-id`). The tenant ID is used to dynamically route the request to the corresponding MongoDB and Elasticsearch instances.

```bash
curl -H "x-tenant-id: tenant1" http://localhost:3000/api/some-endpoint
```

If the tenant ID is missing or invalid, the service will throw an appropriate error.

---

## Kafka Consumer/Producer Integration

This project also integrates **Kafka** for event-driven messaging. **KafkaJS** is used to manage Kafka consumers and producers within NestJS.

### Kafka Consumer

The Kafka consumer listens for messages on specific topics for each tenant and processes them accordingly. For example, a message might update a tenant’s database or trigger an action in Elasticsearch.

### Kafka Producer

The Kafka producer allows the service to send messages to a Kafka topic. This is useful for triggering events, communicating with other microservices, or handling asynchronous workflows.

### Project Structure for Kafka

```bash
src/
│
├── kafka/
│   ├── consumer.service.ts          # Kafka Consumer Service
│   ├── producer.service.ts          # Kafka Producer Service
│   ├── kafka.module.ts              # Kafka Module to organize services
│
└── ...
```

To produce and consume messages, the respective services are used:

- **Producer Service**: Sends messages to Kafka topics.
- **Consumer Service**: Listens to messages and processes them.

Example of sending a Kafka message:

```typescript
this.kafkaProducerService.send({
  topic: 'my-topic',
  messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify(payload) }],
});
```

Example of consuming a Kafka message:

```typescript
this.kafkaConsumerService.consume('my-topic', async (message) => {
  console.log('Received message:', message.value);
});
```

## Environment Variables

The application requires specific environment variables for MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Kafka:

- **MONGODB_URI_default**: Default MongoDB URI for tenants.
- **MONGODB_URI_{tenantId}**: MongoDB URI for each specific tenant.
- **ELASTICSEARCH_NODE**: Elasticsearch node URL.
- **ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY**: API key for Elasticsearch.
- **KAFKA_BROKER_URL**: Kafka broker URL.
- **KAFKA_GROUP_ID**: Group ID for Kafka consumer group.
- **KAFKA_CLIENT_ID**: Client ID for Kafka client.

---

## Error Handling and Reliability

### MongoDB Connection Errors

If the tenant ID provided does not match a valid MongoDB URI, or if there is an issue connecting to MongoDB, the app will throw an error with a descriptive message:

- **Invalid Tenant ID**: If the tenant ID is missing or incorrect.
- **Invalid MongoDB URI**: If the MongoDB URI is invalid.
- **Connection Timeout**: If MongoDB does not respond within a set timeout.

```typescript
if (!mongoUri) {
  throw new Error(`No MongoDB URI found for tenant ID: ${tenantId}`);
}
```

### Input Validation

All inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

---

## Future Scalability

The service is designed for future scalability:

- **Tenant Isolation**: Each tenant has a separate MongoDB database, Elasticsearch index, and Kafka topic, ensuring data and message isolation.
- **Microservices Support**: The architecture can be split into microservices (e.g., one service for MongoDB operations, one for Kafka message handling).
- **Horizontal Scaling**: The application can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances, with Kafka handling shared messaging state across instances.

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

To run unit tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Integration Tests

For integration tests, especially with MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Kafka, ensure the services are running and then execute:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
